# The Semantic Stack
*A proposed public semantic layer for grounding AI, reducing hallucinations, and creating a universal index of meaning.*

## Abstract
Current AI systems hallucinate because the internet lacks a true semantic layer.  
There is no universal topic dictionary, no canonical home for concepts, and no stable external reference system for meaning.

The **Semantic Stack** is a proposed public indexing structure where each topic has:

- **One root**
- **One canonical semantic anchor**
- **Five public external domains that define the topic**
- **A mirror system for plural, category, and contextual expansion**

The goal is to create a card catalog for AI—an external semantic layer the web never built.

# 1. The Missing Semantic Layer
Today’s internet provides:
- URLs  
- pages  
- fragments  
- inconsistent definitions  

But it does **not** provide:
- a global topic dictionary  
- a canonical root per subject  
- a stable semantic anchor  
- public provenance for meaning  

AI compensates by guessing → hallucinations.

The Semantic Stack proposes a structured, external, open index that anyone can host.

# 2. One Topic = One Stack  
Each topic (healthcare, transportation, medicine, etc.) is defined by **five public domains**:

topicType.com
topicEntity.com
topicURL.com
topicSitemap.com
topicCanonical.com

These act as:
- public semantic anchors  
- open reference points  
- external grounding structures  
- canonical definitions  
- topic-level provenance  

The stack owner becomes the **public semantic reference point** for that topic  
(not legal ownership — semantic authority).

---

# 3. Mirror System (Plural, Category, Context)

Mirrors reflect the root but do not replace it.

### **Plural Mirrors**
cars → car
pharmaceuticals → pharmaceutical

markdown
Copy code

### **Category Mirrors**
sportsmedicine → medicine
electriccars → car

markdown
Copy code

### **Context Mirrors**
healthcaredata
transportationreviews
baseballstats

Mirrors expand the topic’s semantic space **without fragmenting the root definition**.

# 4. Why This Matters

## A) AI Hallucination Reduction
A fixed external stack provides:
- a canonical root  
- predictable structure  
- consistent boundaries  
- stable references  
- a true grounding layer  

This creates the **card catalog** AI has always been missing.

---

## B) Provenance & Authenticity  
One topic → one stack → one canonical public definition.

Improves:
- traceability  
- stable meaning  
- topic-level consistency  
- public semantic provenance  

---

## C) Public Semantic Ownership
Because stacks live on **external public domains**, the semantic layer becomes:
- open  
- transparent  
- independent of big tech  
- globally referenceable  

It gives the public a share of the index layer of the internet.

# 5. Questions for the Community
This is an open concept.  
Feedback is welcome on:

- feasibility  
- overlap with RDF / schema.org / Wikidata  
- grounding and knowledge graph implications  
- potential extensions  
- theoretical flaws
